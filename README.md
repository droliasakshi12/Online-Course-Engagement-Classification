# 🎓 Online Course Engagement Classification

A machine learning project to classify and predict student engagement in online courses using Python and scikit-learn. The repository contains notebooks that explore engagement data, build classification models, and evaluate their performance using supervised learning techniques.

## 🔍 Project Summary

Online education systems generate large amounts of interaction data. This project uses that data to train models that can classify whether a student is engaged or not, using features from the dataset. The main learning goals include:

- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Building and evaluating classification models  
- Predicting engagement labels on new data

---

### 🛠 Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Load and explore dataset:** Inspect data, understand variables, handle missing values.  
2. **Preprocess data:** Encode categorical features (if any), split into features and labels.  
3. **Train models:** Use classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree).  
4. **Evaluate:** Measure performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.  
5. **Predict:** Classify engagement on test or new data.

Typical model training uses scikit-learn’s classification utilities.
